# PROGRESS

Running state file for `quantica`. Updated at the end of each working session
(see CLAUDE.md §"Session close-out"). Concise and factual.

**Current phase:** Phase 1 — Derivatives pricing (European options, four ways).

## Completed

- **Project skeleton** — packaging (`pyproject.toml`), ruff + mypy + pytest
  config, CI workflow, `.gitattributes` (LF), tracked `numerical-validation`
  skill under `.claude/skills/`.
- **Step 1 — core types / instrument / process** — `OptionType`,
  `EuropeanOption` (payoff + engine seam), `BlackScholesProcess` (frozen, with
  `with_*` bump helpers, `discount_factor`, `forward`).
- **Step 2 — analytic engine + Greeks** — `AnalyticEuropeanEngine`: Black–Scholes
  closed form + delta/gamma/vega/theta/rho, validated vs bump-and-reval and
  QuantLib (price + all Greeks to `rtol≈1e-10`).
- **Step 3 — implied volatility** — `implied_volatility`: safeguarded Newton
  (via vega) inside a Brent bracket; no-arbitrage-band error handling; round-trip
  + QuantLib-solver benchmark.
- **Step 4 — CRR binomial engine** — `BinomialEngine`: backward induction,
  continuous dividends; `O(1/N)` convergence verified by log-log slope (even-N
  subsequence, sawtooth handled); QuantLib CRR benchmark.
- **Step 5 — Monte Carlo engine** — `MonteCarloEngine`: exact GBM terminal
  simulation, injected seeded `Generator`, antithetic + control variates,
  `estimate()` exposes the standard error; within ~3 SE of analytic; variance
  reduction demonstrated (VRF ~2× antithetic, ~7× control).
- **Step 6 — Crank–Nicolson PDE engine** — `FiniteDifferenceEngine`: BS PDE on a
  log-price grid, CN scheme, tridiagonal solve; second-order `O(h²)` convergence
  verified by a log-log slope of ≈ −2; parity up to discretisation; QuantLib FD
  benchmark.
- **Step 7 — four-way cross-method convergence test** —
  `tests/pricing/test_cross_method.py`: prices the same option under all four
  engines across strikes / maturities / call-put with non-zero dividend, each
  anchored to analytic to a justified per-method tolerance (CRR `O(1/N)` < 2e-3
  at N=2000; PDE `O(h²)` < 1.5e-3 at 500×500; MC within 3 SE, seeded). Completes
  the derivatives-pricing core.
- **Convergence table** — `scripts/convergence_table.py` (seeded, reproducible),
  spans analytic / CRR / MC / PDE; embedded verbatim in the README, which frames
  it as the effective-challenge centrepiece.

## Next

- **Step 8 — thin Streamlit + Plotly app** (`apps/pricing_app.py`), built last:
  sliders → live price, Greek profiles, implied-vol surface, the convergence
  table figure. Thin UI over the tested core — zero pricing logic in `apps/`.

Phase-1 pricing core (steps 1–7) is complete; the app is the remaining Phase-1
deliverable. Note the documented Rannacher/L-stability caveat in
`finitediff.py` if PDE Greeks are ever added.

## Open design notes

- **Ignored-vol market carrier (TODO).** `implied_volatility` and
  `MonteCarloEngine`/tests take a `BlackScholesProcess` whose `vol` is a
  placeholder in IV's case (the unknown being solved for). It's documented and
  tested (answer independent of the passed vol), but the `vol=…` argument reads
  oddly. Consider a dedicated market/quote type carrying only `spot, rate, div`,
  or a `process.without_vol()` view — revisit if a third consumer appears.
- **`estimate()` vs `npv` for MC stats.** The standard error is exposed via
  `MonteCarloEngine.estimate()` rather than threading a stats flag through the
  generic `npv`/`PricingEngine` seam. Deliberate; revisit only if other engines
  need to return stats.
- **mypy targets 3.12** (runtime is 3.11+) because current numpy stubs use the
  3.12 `type` statement; ruff `target-version = "py311"` guards 3.11 syntax.

## How to resume

1. Run the full gate: `ruff format --check . && ruff check . && mypy quantica && pytest`
   (add `-m benchmark` for the QuantLib cross-checks; needs the `benchmark` extra).
2. Skim `git log --oneline` for the last coherent state.
3. Re-read `CLAUDE.md` (durable brief) and `.claude/skills/numerical-validation/SKILL.md`
   (the validation protocol every new numerical method must pass).
