# quantica

A focused, rigorously **tested and validated** quantitative-finance library in
Python, built as a public portfolio of quant engineering: clean API design,
hand-implemented core numerics, disciplined testing, and **independent
validation against an industry reference (QuantLib)**.

The narrative is deliberately that of *model validation*: every numerical
method is cross-checked against at least one other method and, where a
reference exists, benchmarked against QuantLib within a stated tolerance.

> **Status:** Phase 1 (derivatives pricing) in progress. This commit sets up
> the project skeleton and the pricing primitives — the option contract, the
> Black–Scholes market process, and the engine interface. Numerical engines
> (analytic, binomial, Monte Carlo, Crank–Nicolson PDE) follow.

## Architecture

Pricing follows an **Instrument / Process / Engine** separation:

| Concept | Question it answers | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Instrument** | *What* is the contract? | `EuropeanOption` (strike, expiry, payoff) |
| **Process** | *How* does the market move? | `BlackScholesProcess` (spot, rate, div, vol) |
| **Engine** | *How* do we price it numerically? | analytic, tree, MC, PDE *(coming next)* |

```python
from quantica import EuropeanOption, BlackScholesProcess, OptionType

option = EuropeanOption(strike=100.0, expiry=1.0, option_type=OptionType.CALL)
process = BlackScholesProcess(spot=100.0, rate=0.05, div=0.0, vol=0.2)

# Once an engine exists, the same option is priced by swapping engines —
# which is exactly what makes the cross-method convergence test natural:
# option.set_engine(AnalyticEuropeanEngine())
# price = option.npv(process)
```

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"      # install with the dev toolchain

pytest                        # run the test suite
pytest --cov=quantica --cov-report=term-missing
pytest -m benchmark           # QuantLib cross-checks (needs the 'benchmark' extra)

ruff format . && ruff check . # format + lint
mypy quantica                 # type-check
```

CI (ruff · mypy · pytest) runs on every push; the QuantLib benchmark suite runs
as a separate job.
